config SARSENSOR_SX933X
	tristate "sx933x Programming Driver"
	help
	  CapSense devices is the analog system contains the capacitive sensing
	  hardware. Several hardware algorithms are supported. This hardware
	  performs capacitive sensing and scanning without requiring external
	  components. It contains internal flash memory, which have to be programmed
	  with firmware using HSSP interface. Host Sourced Serial Programming (HSSP)
	  refers to the programming of the target device on the board by using a host
	  microcontroller. The PSoC 4 target is programmed through the SWD interface -
	  ARM Serial Ware Debug. This option enables firmware programming driver and
	  allows automatically identify device and matching firmware. See file
	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/capsense_hssp.txt for details.
